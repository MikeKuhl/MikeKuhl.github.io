# Functional Programing


What is functional programming?
-Functional programming  is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments.
What are the benefits of a pure function?
- The function call is independent of other function calls.
What is immutability?
- means the stte can't be changed.  Only way to change the state is to create a new object with a the value that needs to be mutated.
What is Referential transparency?
 - A function call be replaced by its value or a transparent call with the same result.
