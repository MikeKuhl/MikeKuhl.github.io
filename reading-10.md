# DEBUGGING #

- debugging is the process of finding errors. It involes a process of deduction

- the console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located so it is easier tof ind where the error is located.

- Javascript has 8 different types of error.

- To catch an error gracefully you can use try,catch,finally statements.

- It's really important to remember that javascript is an interpeted language. Nothing is compiled like C++ or Java. The browser handles all the processing of the code line by line. Which means that you can also start and stop the code from executing like in the debugger.

- Using the debugger can also be faster than using consle.log that everyone enjoys
