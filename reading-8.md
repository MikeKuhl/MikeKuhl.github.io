# CSS Layouts #

- websites are often divied into headers, menus, content, footer
- usually websites are designed around a grid layout
-page sizes are usually built around 960-1000 pixels wide. As most sers would be able to see the width on their screens. This is also important as you can develop both the mobile and desktop stylings in the same style sheet

-CSS Frameworks are helpful as they are generally tested, helps reduce rewriting the same tasks. the downside being they have more than needed at times as you more than likely won't use the framework to its full capability.

- Block level elements include <h1> <p> <ul> <li>
- inline elements include <img> <b> <i>
