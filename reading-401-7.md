-   Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
-  Receive access token
-  Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
-  Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

	* The client can recieve an access token*
4.  What can you do with an access token?
* The user can access their own secured data
6.  Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
