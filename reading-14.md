- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

 - The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

 ```div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```



 - Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.

 - The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Positive is clockwise/Negative is counterclockwise.

- Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1. .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller for example.

- The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.


# What Google learned About Teams #

That was a good read. I actually very much understand the  problematic issues that can stem from someone or a group of S Tier performers. S being greater than say the A team.  Back in the Navy I had a junior sailor who was unable to open up or be able to share parts of their life. The problem was that it was something done by choice out of fear from others and not for safety. I too learned that with this person being unable to open up and conversate about anything other than work, that it was very stressful to work near or with them. It takes a bit of a toll on others when you're strictly business 100% of the time as everyone is more than the work they output. So I'm not surprised that having several S tier contributors was more difficult than say A or B. A or B are more reliant on others but in the end it also helps you learn from others and benefits the group as a whole. I've done it myself before.  I feel like there is more to grab from the article I just need to read over again due to its length.
