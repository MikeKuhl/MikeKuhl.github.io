# FORMS, LISTS, TABLES #

-The way to collect information from someone is by using a form. Forms are accessed using <form>

- information from a form is sent in name/value pairs
- Each form control is given a name and what is inputed is sent to the server

- Specific css properties are for forms, lists and tables.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties

- table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers but where are properties you can use to contorl them and make them more consistent.

- forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

- Forms benefit from styles that make them more interactive

# EVENTS #

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen and which element you are waiting for that even to happen upon
-When an event occurs on an element it can trigger a javascript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way.
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
- The most common used events are W3c DOM Events.
