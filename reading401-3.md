# Readings: Express
1.  What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
	1. PUT puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI. If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.
	2. PATCH can be used to update partial resources. [Patch](https://restcookbook.com/HTTP%20Methods/patch/)
2.  Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like `json-server`
	1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
	2. [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)
	3. [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/)
3.  Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
	1. Swgger is a cloud based API testing and APIDoc creates documentation from api references in the source code.
	2. Successful would be 2xx codes and unsuccessful will be 4xx or 5xx codes.
4.  Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
	1. REST supports JSON and XML, while SOAP only supports XML.
	2. REST is faster but SOAP is more secure.

1.Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
	1. Clarity of status codes
	2. importance of CRUD
	3. ReST
2.  Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
	1. Testing
	2. More diving into Express espicially for clarity sake.
	3. More testing
3.  What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
	1. Everything working! Seriously I don't know. I just get happy when things work smoothly as it feels like a check in the box. I just want more experience doing things from scratch even if it's small. I find myself relying on examples all the time instead of finding a way to imeplement the topic or the method/technology etc on my own. I find it benefits me more.
