Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

- What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
Makes development easy and less confusing in javascript. As javascript is moving away from a "Class" based system and a "component" based system.

Components make it easy to replace and modify items as needed.

Components are reusable and can be mutated/modified after they are created for specific use cased.

Component based programing is reliable as the components should be self reliant and not dependent on anything else.

Components allow for updates and implementations without impacting the rest of the program.
